      <h1>The Letters from No One ðŸ¦„</h1>
      <p>
        The escape of the Brazilian boa constrictor earned Harry his
        longest-ever punishment. By the time he was allowed out of his cupboard
        again, the summer holidays had started and Dudley had already broken his
        new cine-camera, crashed his remote-control aeroplane and, first time on
        his racing bike, knocked down old Mrs Figg as she crossed Privet Drive
        on her crutches. Harry was glad school was over, but there was no
        escaping Dudley's gang, who visited the house every single day. Piers,
        Dennis, Malcolm and Gordon were all big and stupid, but as Dudley was
        the biggest and stupidest of the lot, he was the leader. The rest of
        them were all quite happy to join in Dudley's favourite sport:
        Harry-hunting.

        BOOM. They knocked again. Dudley jerked awake. 'Where's the cannon?' he
        said stupidly. There was a crash behind them and Uncle Vernon came
        skidding into the room. He was holding a rifle in his hands - now they
        knew what had been in the long, thin package he had brought with them.
        'Who's there?' he shouted. 'I warn you - I'm armed!' There was a pause.
        Then - SMASH! The door was hit with such force that it swung clean off
        its hinges and with a deafening crash landed flat on the floor. A giant
        of a man was standing in the doorway. His face was almost completely
        hidden by a long, shaggy mane of hair and a wild, tangled beard, but you
        could make out his eyes, glinting like black beetles under all the hair.

        Harry woke early the next morning. Although he could tell it was
        daylight, he kept his eyes shut tight. ''It was a dream, he told himself
        firmly. ''I dreamed a giant called Hagrid came to tell me I was going to
        a school for wizards. When I open my eyes I'll be at home in my
        cupboard. There was suddenly a loud tapping noise. ''And there's Aunt
        Petunia knocking on the door, Harry thought, his heart sinking. But he
        still didn't open his eyes. It had been such a good dream. Tap. Tap.
        Tap.
